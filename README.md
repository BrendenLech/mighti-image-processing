# MIGHTI Image Processing

Code to practice processing data from ICON's MIGHTI instrument. Below is a simulation of 630nm nightglow emission using [Pyglow](https://github.com/timduly4/pyglow), a simulated image generated from that emission profile, and an emission profile derived back from that image.
