# MIGHTI Image Processing

Code to practice processing data from ICON's MIGHTI instrument. Below are:
1. A simulation of 630nm nightglow emission using [Pyglow](https://github.com/timduly4/pyglow)
2. A simulated image generated from that emission profile
3. An emission profile derived back from that image
4. A graph of the error between the derived profile and true simulated profile

## Images and Graphs:

### Graphs and images for 630nm nightglow simulated using Pyglow:
