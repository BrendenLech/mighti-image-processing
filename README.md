# MIGHTI Image Processing

Code to practice processing data from ICON's MIGHTI instrument. Below are two test cases with three generated images and graphs each. The first test case simulates emission following a normal distribution peaking at 200km altitude, and the second simulates emission peaking at 300km altitude.

## Images and Graphs:

### Graphs and images for the case of maximum emission at 200km altitude:
